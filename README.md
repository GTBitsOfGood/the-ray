The Ray has a plethora of data from several years of sustainability research and activities, but does not have a good way to display it. The Ray needs an intuitive, interactive visualization of data across time and category, to aid in soliciting interest from grants, corporations, and the public at large. This webapp intends to fufill that goal through a form of data driven journalism.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
